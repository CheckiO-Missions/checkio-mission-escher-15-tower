    <div class="answer">
        At first, you can create a function which will "rotate" a single cube and check 24 possible positions of it (each side will be the top side and for every such situation also will be 4 possible variants for the other sides position, so 6x4=24).

        Now you can check all possible combinations of a few cubes standing one on one and check if their sides have the same colors.

    <div class="question">
        And how can I get the right answer?
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        From all variants you've analyzed, you should select those, where side sides have the same colors. And then select the set of cubes, which consists of the maximum amount of cubes.
